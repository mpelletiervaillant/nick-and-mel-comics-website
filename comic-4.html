        <p class="light navy giga push-1-2">In this comic, Mel questions her relationship with a very important figure in her life.</p>
        <p class="light navy push-1-2">So I love cats, but Nick won't let me get a cat (don't worry, he's' being the good guy, I am very allergic and he reminds me constantly). So when I see my family's cat Harry, I show him all the love, pet him, brush him, cuddle him... but he always just doesn't care and walks away. Then Nick shows up and literally calls him an asshole, and Harry just loves on him. *Sigh* </p>
