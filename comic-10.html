        <p class="light navy push-1-2">My parents had shown us Harry Potter when we were kids... but I got so scared by Voldemort that I refused to sleep (my mom finally resulted to putting my Power Puff Girl toys near my door promising they would protect me from him). After that traumatic experience, I never gave the franchise another chance. Finally Nick convinced me, and well, let's just say I get it now. </p>
