        <p class="light navy giga push-1-2">One day Mel was browsing Youtube, and found out some people own elephants.</p>
        <p class="light navy">I didn't realize some people owned elephants! In the moment I thought it was really cool; they went swimming togehter, they hung out, they cuddled... When I brought up the idea to Nick he looked around our 500 sqft apartment and just shooked his head. Oh well... I tried.</p>
