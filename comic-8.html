        <p class="light navy">I like watching chick flicks... so when we watch Nick's movie pick I often ask a lot of questions really early on, like 'Wait who is that?', and he says 'I don't know, I'm watching the same movie as you are'. It took him a while to figure out that the reason I ask so many questions early on is because Chick Flicks essentially spoil the entire plot in the first 5 minutes of exposition...</p>
