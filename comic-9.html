        <p class="light navy push-1-2">I jumped on the plant train this year for no logical reason. I don't know why, but it became a pretty big hobby of mine to research every plant really make sure to name them according to their personalities. I know other people also do this, so I wanted to share our plants! Nick knows all the names now and even helps me name them (he named Sonic, could you tell?).</p>
